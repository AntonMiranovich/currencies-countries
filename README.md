The web application contains a user interface created using HTML and styled using CSS. Using the React library allows you to control the interface and state of the application.

The Axios library is used to send GET requests. It makes it easier to make HTTP requests and interact with the web server. In this case, the application sends GET requests to the specified URL to obtain exchange rate data.

The received data can be displayed on the web application page or processed for further use.

Thus, this web application allows users to obtain up-to-date information on exchange rates using GET requests to a URL and interacting with the server using the Axios library. It provides a convenient and fast way to obtain exchange rate data for further analysis or use.
